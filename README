README

You need to do few things before you can start running the rails application because we didnt check in all the files into the version control system.

Firstly no log folder is present and rails doesnt like if there are no logs. so make sure to create log folder.

mkdir log
touch log/production.log
touch log/development.log
touch log/server.log
touch log/test.log

Also databases are not created, so you might have to create that from the schema file.

rake db:create
rake db:schema:load
